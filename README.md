# Swift Type Mismatch Bug

This repository demonstrates a common type mismatch error in Swift.  The `calculateArea` function is designed to accept two `Double` values representing width and height. However, an attempt to pass a `String` for the `height` parameter leads to a compiler error. This highlights the importance of type safety in Swift.
